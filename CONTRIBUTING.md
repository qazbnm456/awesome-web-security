# Contribution Guidelines

(your commit message will be a tweet, keep that in mind :)

- **To add to the list:** Submit a pull request
- **To remove from the list:** Submit a pull request
- want to change something: Submit a pull request
- want to try something else: Submit a pull request
- don't know what to do: Submit a pull request or open an issue, let us know what's going on.

`awesome-web-security` is a hand-crafted list for high-quality information about web security and its resources. It would be nice if it is related or compatible with web security in some way. But if it's awesome, let's us know why and you're on!

- Each item should be limited to one link, no duplicates, no redirection (careful with `http` vs `https`!)
- The link should be the name of the slide or project or website
- Description should be clear and concise (read it out loud to be sure)
- Description should follow the link, on the same line
- if you want to add more than one link, please don't do all PR on the exact same line, it usually results in conflicts and your PR cannot be automatically merged...

Please contribute links to slides/projects you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.

# Quality standard

Note that we can help you achieve those standards, just try your best, be brave.
We'll guide you to the best of our abilities.

To be on the list, it would be *nice* if entries adhere to these quality standards:

- Generally useful to the community
- Clearly stating "what is it for": mention the problem it solves. Just try your best, make it clear for the next person.
- Solves a real problem (even a small one)
- if it is a **WIP** (work in progress, not safe for production), mention it.

If your PR is not merged, we will tell you why so that you may be able to improve it.

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
